## Todo
- Add a frequency called "Total" (default)
- Add an "overall" cost per product (right now we just have `$price/ea`) in agreement
- Add electronically signing a contract
- Add messaging chat feature that is enabled after an inquiry is accepted
- Remove start date from an inquiry (mention that the start date will be when both parties have signed)
- Modify end date to have preset options: in "1 month" (after start), "2 months" (after start), etc. or "custom date"
- Change wording on aggreement "Effective on date of execution ("Effective start "date") ending {term length, i.e. "3 months after"}
- Modify "Notes" to "comments"

## Future todo
- Bullet proof signin/signup/password reset workflow

## Workflow
